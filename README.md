# You've been Biebered!
Know someone who leaves their device unlocked and has no trust issues? Fix this quickly with these 4 easy steps!:

1. Visit [bieber.party](https://bieber.party)
2. Copy the command for their device
3. Run the command in a terminal
4. Let your friend enjoy their brand new desktop background of acclaimed Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Drew Bieber!

They'll never leave their device unlocked ever again! (until next week when they do it again)

Contents of the scripts are found in the repository (windows, macos, gnome, kde). ChromeOS is too locked down to allow for editing of background images using commands.
